# Category 1 connect - First meeting
I met them in the grocery store. I was picking up some fresh vegetables for dinner and they were buying frozen pizzas. 
I met them at an art gallery. It was an opening for some new kid who paints rotting vegetables. We cautiously told each other our opinions until we felt comfortable enough to laugh out loud. 
We met in night-school, both of us trying to get a better understanding of business marketing but catching each other staring and quickly looking away.
I literally crashed into them when the metro made an unexpected stop and I was not holding onto anything. I felt so embarrassed because I spilled my coffee all over their shirt. But then again, they were pretty good looking, so I offered to pay for the dry cleaning and got their number in the process.

# Category 1 disconnect - First fight
It was when they called me their "special friend" in front of their friends, as if there was something to be ashamed in us being together. When I confronted them about it, they said that they needed more time to tell them. We had already been dating for 2 years. How much more time did they need?They got really drunk at a party, and flirted with another person there. They never admitted it, but all of my friends told me about it. I ignored them for three days after that.
We fought over who was supposed to take out the trash. In the end, we decided to take turns.
I was late to work because they took forever in the washroom beautifying themselves up.

# Category 2 connect - First kiss
The first time we kissed, it was when we were both drunk, me slightly less, so with my alcohol induced courage, decided to kiss them. There was not anything particularly sweet or romantic about it, but we both did not seem to mind.
Our first kiss tasted like that artificial sweet cherry taste because of that slush drink they got from the dépanneur on the corner street of their apartment.
It was after our third date together, and they were the one who pulled me down for the kiss after we kept talking in front of their place. I remember standing there in that post-kiss euphoric daze, not really knowing what had happened.

# Category 2 disconnect - First thing they hated in the other person
I realized that I could not stand the way they always seemed to have the last say in our arguments, and they would ignore my opinions.
I realized that one day, the way they laughed in front of others and me was different, and I could not for the world understand why theirs seemed more forced and hollow with me. But after that, I could not get it out of mind how bored they started to look when they were with me.

# Category 3 connect -  Random Moments (of love)
We had a date at the movie theater, and to be honest, I do not even remember what movie we went to see, just that it was some serious movie, and we could not stop laughing because one of the actors looked like someone we knew. It was like seeing them be so out of character all the time. We got some strange looks, but I could not have cared less.
I called them up at 3AM one night because I could not sleep because I was so stressed out about that deadline for the work project. We talked until 7 in the morning and only stopped because I realized that they had also work at 9. They never mentioned anything the entire time.
They were great. Being with them was even greater. Because they honestly just felt like home to me. 

# Category 3 disconnect - Random argument
I called them out for being rude to me at a party with their friends, but they told me that I was overreacting and was overthinking things. Neither of us ended up apologizing, but we just pretended that nothing happened after a few days.
One week they did not answer my calls or texts, and I got so worried. When they finally showed up, I told them how worried I was, but they seemed more annoyed than anything else and snapped back at me saying that their business was theirs alone and that they were allowed some privacy.

# Category 4 connect - Moving in
We were window shopping when we passed by this fancy furniture shop. It was way out of our budget, but we were just looking and they asked me really casually if I would like to spend more time getting to know each other if we saw each other more often.
They just started coming by my house and were leaving more and more of their things at my place. I did not mind because it gave more life to my dull place, and for once, I had someone to return to whenever I came back home.
I stayed over one night and left my toothbrush in their toilet. They asked me to come pass by their place one day, and I kind of just kept staying overnight.

# Category 4 disconnect - Giving the pet away / it dies
When we broke up, they kept the cat. And good riddance. I grew to hate that fucking thing. 
When we were still living together, our dog Betsy got really sick. We were up all night for weeks giving him medication. After he passed, our apartment was so quiet and lifeless. It stayed that way. 
When we broke up we decided that neither of should keep our pet rabbit we got together. We gave it to a little girl as a birthday gift from her mother. We told her all about how often she should feed the bunny and change its cage. She nodded extremely seriously as tears of joy streamed down her face.
I kept our dog after breaking up but I regret it. Taking her for a walk, feeding her, when she sleeps in my bed, I am constantly reminded of them -- or reminded that they are no longer there. 

# Category 5 connect - Meeting parents
I was never on good terms with my parents, especially with my father who questioned my career choices. But when they came into my life, we were somehow able to reconnect, and they apologized for being so childish. I was never so grateful to meeting and being with them.
The first time I met their parents at some dinner, I was so stressed at making a bad first impression, but they told me that even if they did not warm up to them, it did not matter.
their parents were amazingly nice to me and so welcoming, we ate like pigs and we all laughed so much when they showed their childhood pictures.

# Category 5 disconnect - Bails out from dates
We had a dinner date with my parents, but they just never showed up. I had lie to them and say that they were held back by work and could not make it. I ca not believe that I lied to my own family for them.
I was waiting for them to pick me up from work like our usual schedule, and it was rainy plus I would forgotten my umbrella. I ended up waiting nearly two hours for them to show up. I was so angry, and they never told me why it took so long.
They did not show up for one of the dinners with some of my friends, and I had to admit, I was kind of relieved and glad. I did not want to embarrassed by them, and they said they had nothing in common with them.

# Category 6 connect - How they started dating
We never really went through the whole ‘confession’ thing, things kind of just fell into place where we hung out together long enough that people started associating us together. Then one day we both came to an understanding that dating would not be bad.
I acted out this entire sequence from one of our favorite movies, and at the end of it I asked them out. I practiced it out hundreds of times, and it was so embarrassing, but it was worth it. They were worth it.
They came knocking on my door with a Ring-Pop and asked me so formally. It was so cheesy, but I loved it. I still have the leftover piece of plastic from that candy. 

# Category 6 disconnect - How the breakup happened
We had not met for over a month because we were both so busy, but one day they called me for a date at a coffee shop to discuss something pretty important. It was our last date. They decided to pull the plug on whatever was left of us, I guess. I could not quite find it in myself to disagree.
I guess the breakup happened the same time that whatever was left between ‘us’ was just 'them' and ‘me’, two single entities. I could not believe that the person standing in front of me was once the only person I could ever care about and even considered. We promised to just be friends and parted with a handshake. I still remember their cold and tight grasp over mine before we both went our own ways. I did not look back.
I guess some things were not meant to be. And we were a mistake I wish I would never made.
When I look at them, it was not the same sparks and butterflies in my chest from our first days. It was an annoyance and the desire to never see them again.
