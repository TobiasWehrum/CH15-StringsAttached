# Category 1 connect - First Date
They took me to a fancy restaurant for our first date. It was too fancy. We were awkward and robotic and forced boring conversation. It was a miracle we agreed to see each other again. 
For our first date, I took them out to dinner and a movie. Classic, maybe a bit uninspired. We went to see Casablanca at an old arthouse theatre and I kept looking over for their reaction. 
We never really had a first date. We hung out a lot and then I guess we just started dating?  
It was not until we were well into dating that we realized we never had a true formal first date. We decided to go out to that new restaurant downtown where you wait in line for an hour. They brought me flowers and I kissed them like it was the first time we kissed. 

# Category 1 disconnect - First anti-date
We used to love going out. We went out to anything. Dinner, friend’s birthdays, garage sales, movies screened in parks, music festivals, pop-up arcades. And then slowly, we loved it less and stayed home, silent, more and more.
At first we would not need anything to entertain us. We would just talk. Anywhere. We would miss our subway stop because we were so involved in our conversation. And then the unthinkable happened: we ran out of things to tell each other. We went to more and more parties where other people could carry the conversation.
I remember we got in a huge fight once. We were getting ready to go to their brother’s engagement party. I got so mad I yelled Fuck it! I’m not going anywhere! They went to the party crying and alone. 
We just got so lazy. We would make plans to go out and do stuff but when it came around, we would make excuses to stay at home, in different rooms.

# Category 2 connect - Compliment
I remember when they first told me they love the scar on my eyebrow. It was so sweet and I felt so seen, so recognized, like I never was before. 
When I first told them I love how they have a dimple on only one cheek when they smile really big. They did not believe me and went on about how much she hates it and think it makes their face look lopsided. 
They told me they love the way my nose crinkles when I laugh really loudly. I made sure to crinkle my nose extra big from then on.
I never felt more love than when they told me they felt like we’ve known each other for hundreds of years and that they want to know me for hundreds more.

# Category 2 disconnect - Ignoring / Complimenting someone else
They constantly told me I never gave them enough compliments, that they did not feel pretty. I told them as much as I could how amazing they were but it was never enough.
They would always tell me they love the way I spoke my mind, how I was direct and honest. I think maybe they liked the idea of that more than the reality of it.
I remember feeling so special when they told me I have the most interesting eyes they’ve ever seen. And I remember feeling so broken when I overheard them telling someone else that exact same thing. 
They used to tell me all they time I want you. I want you. I thought it was a special thing between us. Until they left their email open and I found I want you written to someone else.

# Category 3 connect - Meeting friends
I met their friends at yet another art gallery opening someone they know was putting on. Their friends seemed disinterested in me. I do not know if they even told them my name. 
They invited me to a friend’s birthday dinner. We sat at one of those large tables where you can only hear the people directly beside you. I sat next to them and on my other side was someone who faced the other way the whole time. 
We went over to their best friend’s house for a dinner party a bit into dating each other. Everyone was amazing. It was like I was at home with my own family, but better. We stayed into the middle of the night at first drinking wine then whatever else was around, talking about politics, art, latest reality tv drama. I was so in love. 

# Category 3 disconnect - Not telling you where they’re going / Asking you not to come with them
They slowly stopped inviting me to things. And then they would not even tell me where they were going. I got so paranoid. I would look through their phone when they were not in the room to see what they were up to. Once I even followed them but… They just went out to a movie alone. 
I hated that they constantly asked me where I was going. I got a million texts a day checking in on me. I felt like a child. 
I found myself willing to do anything for a moment alone, a moment of peace. I would sneak away soon as they fell asleep just to feel like I was by myself. 
Once, when we were having a very frank and honest conversation I told them I did not want them to come to a reception of a play I was in because I did not want to worry about introducing them and looking after them. I regret being that honest. They cried and cried and I felt terrible.

# Category 4 connect - Getting a pet
I always wanted a dog, one of those huge fluffy ones. They said they were allergic but I suspected they just did not want to share a life with me. After we had a big fight, they agreed to buy a dog, but a little hairless one. It was always shakey and yelping.
I hate animals but they loved them so much. When we first started dating they had three cats and a rabbit. Their apartment stank. Before moving in I set an ultimatum that I could only handle one cat or the rabbit. 
Getting a dog together was a huge moment for us. We went to the humane society and adopted a rescue. He was so starved that we had to sign a form saying if he died within the next two weeks, we could not hold the shelter at fault. He lived and grew so fat and happy.  
They had a cat that they used to share with their ex. The cat’s name was Lucy. I hated Lucy because it reminded me that they were in love with someone else and could be again. 

# Category 4 disconnect - Moving out
I told them they should move out. It was my apartment. The lease was under my name. I did not even want the apartment but I did not want them to have it either. 
I hated every moment of packing up my stuff, dividing my things from theirs, making impossible divisions. 
We both decided to move out and sublet our apartment so we would not have to decide who stays and gets the nice apartment and a ghost of the other, and who gets their life refreshed. 
They did not even formally move out. They just took off after an argument one night, and then their friend came by for their stuff a few weeks later.

# Category 5 connect - Random moment
We once took a trip together up north. It was below 40 and there was a snowstorm and a tree branch broke onto the electrical wires. We huddled together under all the blankets we could find and lit every candle that was there. That was one of the best times we had together. 
I remember once we were walking down the street, and they just grabbed my hand really tightly, looked at me and told me they loved me. It was so small, so mundane, but it’s such a strong memory, I can still feel it. 
When we would go to restaurants we would eat off each other’s plates without asking. It was normal. We shared everything. 
I remember when they got that really bad fever in the fall. I would make them cups and cups of ginger and lemon tea. I would still kiss them even though they told me over and over I would get sick, but I did not mind. I would have loved to stay home sick with them all day.

# Category 5 disconnect - Random unhappy moment
Once they told me I was acting angry and cranky but I did not feel like I was. The rest of the night was spent mostly silent, me second guessing my feelings, wondering if they were projecting their feelings onto me. 
They got upset so often. I felt like everything I said made everything worse. I did not feel like I was a good influence on their wellbeing.
When they lost their job, I would try to help them find another one, searching websites and asking friends. But everything I suggested was just turned down, or they would say they would but would never get around to applying. It was exhausting.

# Category 6 connect - Getting a key
I remember they first gave me a key as a way to make up for a fight we had. Silly me. It was a way to cover the fight up without actually apologizing or saying sorry.
I gave them a key to my apartment only a few weeks into dating. Maybe I was foolish and fast-paced, but I had never felt that way about anybody else before and I thought that meant something.
I reluctantly gave them a key to my apartment a bit into dating. I hated the idea of someone, even someone I loved, just randomly appearing in my apartment without me knowing about it. But I could not tell them that because I wanted them to be happy. 
They made a big scene out of exchanged keys to each other’s apartments. It was so sweet and silly. They played orchestral music off youtube, got down on one knee, pulled out a box from their jacket. I reached to open it, horrified. Before I could grab it, they opened the box and said I love you! It’s just a key! 

# Category 6 disconnect - Drifting away
Once we got in a big fight and they asked me to give back their key to their apartment. I refused and refused until they said they would call the police. That was one of the worst nights of my life. 
I remember daydreaming about changing the locks to my apartment. They would just come over and not be able to get in. I would change my number, avoid our hang out spots, and just never see them again. I daydreamed this a lot. 
Months after we broke up and moved out, I finally got around to opening the boxes labelled with their name. It was melancholic I suppose, but I was surprised at how little emotion was attached to their hairbrush, a note they wrote me, the tacky necklace they bought me when we were on vacation. I was ok. 
A few weeks after the break up, I went to return their box of stuff I found in my stuff. I still had a key so I was just going to go while they were at work and leave the stuff and the key inside. When I got there, the locks have been changed. I do not know if they moved and did not tell me, or did not want me to have a key to their apartment and changed the locks themselves. I left the box outside with a note on it. I do not know if they ever got it.
